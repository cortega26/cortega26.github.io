# PR Plan â€” fix/backlog-b008-b009

## Objective
Resolve the pending trust & safety and SEO backlog items by replacing the EduTecno PC2 footer joke with a legitimate support contact and expanding English portfolio structured data.

## Scope of this PR
1. **EduTecno PC2 trust copy (B-008)**
   - Remove the "hack the Pentagon" gag link.
   - Replace it with a support-focused mailto call-to-action in the footer.
2. **Portfolio structured data expansion (B-009)**
   - Publish a Schema.org `ItemList` of highlighted case studies.
   - Annotate each featured project as a `CreativeWork` with descriptive metadata.

## Deferred to follow-up PRs
- None; backlog cleared.

## Testing plan
- Manual check of EduTecno PC2 footer link destination and label.
- Structured data validation via Google Rich Results Test (static reasoning in lieu of live run).
