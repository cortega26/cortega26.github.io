# Rewrite Proposals (English)

## Home · en/index.html
- Recast the hero automation message to stress instrumented pilots that document actual time savings before any scaling claims. **Roadmap** — capture time-tracking exports after automation pilots and publish summaries.
- Rework the fraud lookup highlight to focus on planned load testing and validation milestones rather than numerical multipliers. [Evidence](https://github.com/cortega26/FastSearchAPI#api-endpoints) · **Roadmap** — schedule latency study and release benchmarks once complete.
- Swap the "trusted-partner status" claim for proof-backed signals such as published testimonials or case-study quotes; until then, describe the collaboration framework (playbooks, cadences) without status language. **Roadmap** — collect stakeholder testimonials.
- In the experience timeline, cite tangible artifacts instead of implied executive adoption (e.g., "Published GDP per-capita dashboard used in quarterly briefings" with link to the Flourish story). [Evidence](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/9177797/)
- Document measurable outcomes for the 2024 decision-intelligence initiatives or soften to "maintained" language referencing the public repos until usage analytics are added. [Evidence](https://github.com/cortega26/crypto-price-tracker) · [Evidence](https://github.com/cortega26/PoGo)
- Calibrate the contact SLA promise to "typically reply within two business days" and pair it with CRM or auto-responder proof once available. **Roadmap** — surface SLA tracker screenshot.

- Support the "Updated weekly" statement by embedding an automated timestamp badge or changelog snippet fed by Git metadata. **Roadmap** — add change history widget.
- Highlight active module links with a short description (e.g., "Module 2 · Available — Digimon API practice with live data fetch") to provide context and reinforce the verified destination. [Evidence](projects/edutecno/pc2/prueba_consolidacion_2.html)

## Product · projects/edutecno/pc2/prueba_consolidacion_2.html
- Introduce a briefing panel summarizing prerequisites, API uptime considerations, and expected learning outcomes so the exercise stands alone for students. **Roadmap** — draft contextual copy and SLA notes.

## Cart / Checkout Analogue · en/index.html#contact
- Augment the intake form with privacy expectations (data retention, response channel) and link to forthcoming policy pages to align with compliance requirements. **Roadmap** — publish privacy/terms pages and link them here.

## Search · (not yet implemented)
- Stand up a basic search-results template that indexes hero sections, capabilities, and project cards, enabling cross-language discovery. **Roadmap** — design search IA and content index.

## 404 · (not yet implemented)
- Create a branded 404 page that clarifies navigation options (Home, Projects, Contact) and surfaces the most-requested resources. **Roadmap** — draft layout in docs/patches.

## Policy Pages · (not yet implemented)
- Produce bilingual Privacy, Cookie, and Terms pages outlining data collection for the contact form, Calendly embeds, and GitHub hosting. **Roadmap** — collaborate with legal reviewer for policy drafts.
